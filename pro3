Q.n.4)The following relations keep track of airline flight information: Flights (flno: integer, from: string, to: string, distance: integer,
departs: time, arrives: time, price: integer) Aircraft (aid: integer, aname: string, cruisingrange: integer) Certified (eid: integer,
aid: integer) Employees (eid: integer, ename: string, salary: integer) Note that the Employees relation describes pilots and other kinds of
employees as well; every pilot is certified for some aircraft, and only pilots are certified to fly. For the above schema, perform the following.


a) Create the above tables by specifying primary keys and foreign keys.
 b) Insert around 10 records in each of the tables. 
c) Find the names of aircraft such that all pilots certified to operate them earn more than 80,000.
 d) For each pilot who is certified for more than three aircraft, find the eid and the maximum cruising range of the aircraft that
he (or she) is certified for. 
e)Find the names of pilots whose salary is less than the price of the cheapest route from Los Angeles to Honolulu. 
f) Find the second highest salary of an employee.
